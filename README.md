Javascript 3D graphics library

Here's my attempt at it. Nothing complete or usefull.

- Shapes (meshes)
- Groups
- Point light sources
- Transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)
- Coordinate conversions (world to view to perspective to screen)
- Wireframe drawer (mesh plus axes)
- Shading (flat and Phong, rasterization needs fixes)
- Primitive generator (cube, sphere, cone, cylinder, disk)
